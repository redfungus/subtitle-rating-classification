Good morning, everyone...

So listen, guys,
we are not in good shape.

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,488
The whole
doing-business-in-China thing

17
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:47,323
has sort of
bitten us in the ass.

18
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:51,127
And now we aren't selling enough
weed to keep up with our costs.

You see this?
This right here?

We no longer get any of that
sweet Chinese money

all the money we do make

Nice attitude. How do we sell
more weed? Sharon?

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,055
If you don't make commercials
or do more parades for the town

31
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:21,023
we'd have more money.

It's like -- we sell
all the good parts of the weed

00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:35,471
but we throw away, like,
tons and tons

the left over shit.

160
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:32,602
And you can eat a lot of 'em
and not feel bloated.

161
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:36,305
Towelie's had, like, 12!

162
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:38,908
Best burgers I ever had.

163
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:42,645
Mmm.

164
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:44,547
Mmm. Oh, my God.

165
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:46,582
School cafeteria ribs.

166
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,684
After all that yogurt and crap
they gave me at the hospital.

167
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:50,353
Mmm!

168
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:52,255

Barbecue Rib Day ♪

I like Rib Day ♪

172
00:06:57,995 --> 00:07:01,330
Wendy: Everyone? Everyone, can I
have your attention, please?

173
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:04,667
Look, guys. We're supposed to be
the young generation, right?

174
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:08,337
We're the ones upset about
the world our parents left us.

175
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:10,706
Yeah, but eating
this kind of food

176
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:12,742
makes us all
just as guilty.

177
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:15,878
The millions and millions
of cows and pigs and chickens

178
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,415
that we harvest every year are a
huge reason for climate change.

179
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:23,719
It is up to us as students
to protest for change.

180
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,855
Young voices matter!

181
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:28,958
Without sustainable
and ethical food choices now,

182
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,861
we're proving to be no --

183
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:34,864
Can I please just enjoy my lunch
for five God damn minutes.

184
00:07:34,865 --> 00:07:36,666
You gotta calm down, Eric,
Remember your condition --

185
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,467
We all have freedom of speech

186
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:40,703
but stop talking about climate
change during lunchtime!

187
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:42,371
Okay, let's sit down.

188
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:43,606
Some of us are trying to
just enjoy some simple

189
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:45,741
God damn barbecue ribs
and I --

190
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:49,045
Oh, God they did it
to me again, Butters.

191
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:51,948
Eric!
I think this is the big one.

192
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:53,516
Don't let me die.
Somebody, help!

193
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:55,384
Don't let me d-
don't let me die, butters!

194
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:00,289
Clear.

195
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,724
We got him back.

196
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,859
Fuck you Wendy.

197
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,696
So that's one Whopper,
one order of chicken strings,

198
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:08,064
and a medium beverage...

199
00:08:08,065 --> 00:08:10,433
Randy: Burgers!
Get your burgers here!

200
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:11,634
Okay that'll be fif--

201
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:13,769
Plant-based burgers
for sale!

202
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,038
Excuse me one moment.

203
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,773
Get your hamburgers here!

204
00:08:17,774 --> 00:08:19,942
Plant-based burgers for sale!

205
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:21,777
Hey!
What are you doing?

206
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:25,348
I'm sellin' hamburgers! All
natural, completely plant based.

207
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:28,017
Thank you sir.
You can't sell hamburgers here,

208
00:08:28,018 --> 00:08:29,785
this is a Burger King!

209
00:08:29,786 --> 00:08:31,020
You sell hamburgers here.

210
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:33,055
Yeah, you sell
hamburgers here.

211
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:34,557
This is seriously
as good or better

212
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:35,891
than a real hamburger.

213
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:37,627
Can I get a couple more
to take to work?

214
00:08:37,628 --> 00:08:39,762
Hey now look, buddy!

215
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:42,665
I'm not gonna lose customers
because of you!

216
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,101
We have plant-based burgers
inside as well!

217
00:08:45,102 --> 00:08:47,069
Come try
our Impossible burger!

218
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,939
Tegridy burger! Made locally
right here in South Park!

219
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,407
Tegridy burger.

220
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:53,342
Stop that!

221
00:08:53,343 --> 00:08:54,744
Alright, everyone, listen up.

222
00:08:54,745 --> 00:08:56,112
As you know,
there are several students

223
00:08:56,113 --> 00:08:57,813
protesting the school menu.

224
00:08:57,814 --> 00:08:59,949
But there are other students
who are voicing

225
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,751
their concerns against changes.

226
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:03,819
Eric Cartman is still recovering
in the hospital,

227
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,688
we all wish him well.

228
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:07,590
Now the school has been
looking into several options

229
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:08,991
to deal with problem.

230
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:11,827
And I do believe
we have found a compromise.

231
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:14,463
We have found a new company
in the plant-based

232
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:16,632
fast food industry
who would like to be

233
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:18,668
the supplier
for our cafeteria.

234
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:23,072
And so please welcome the
founder of Incredible Meat.

235
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:26,709
Hello, children.

236
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,711
I want to thank you
and I want to thank

237
00:09:28,712 --> 00:09:30,813
your fine principal,
for hearing me out.

238
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:34,083
I take plants
and I process them into goo.

239
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:35,718
I am a goo man.

240
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,687
I have factories
all over the country.

241
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:39,722
I have trucks right now
loaded with goo

242
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:41,490
that can be here
within the week.

243
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,893
The goo I speak of
can be made into anything.

244
00:09:43,894 --> 00:09:45,461
It can be made into tacos.

245
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:47,597
It can be made into hot dogs.

246
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:49,699
And I promise you
that none of your students

247
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,767
will know the difference.

248
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:53,636
I would very much like to be
the plant-based meat vendor

249
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:55,171
for your school.

250
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:56,806
I would like to be
the plant-based meat vendor

251
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:58,574
for your town.

252
00:09:58,575 --> 00:10:00,843
I'm a simple family man
and a vegetarian.

253
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:02,645
I would like the opportunity
to make you all

254
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:04,047
vegetarians as well.
And I thank you.

255
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:13,858
Randy:
Eating meat doesn't just hurt
animals, it hurts people.

256
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:15,826
It takes 13 pounds of grain
to produce

257
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:18,529
just 1 pound of animal meat.

258
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,765
All that plant food
could be used

259
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:25,236
much more efficiently
if people just ate it directly.

260
00:10:25,237 --> 00:10:28,406
Meat is also
not environmentally friendly.

261
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:30,508
Meat production is wasteful
and causes

262
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:32,410
enormous amounts of pollution,

263
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:41,285
and the meat industry
is one of the biggest --

264
00:10:41,286 --> 00:10:42,887
Huh?

265
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:45,856
Oh, I was just saying
that adopting a vegan diet

266
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:48,559
is way more effective
than switching to

267
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,529
a "greener" car in the fight
against climate change.

268
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,631
For your health,
for our planet,

269
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:55,633
for the animals,
and for each other.

270
00:10:55,634 --> 00:10:59,570
We have to switch
to plant-based foods.

271
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:02,574

Oh, Incredible Beef Tacos.
That sounds nice.

Hmm?

295
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:51,482
Did you guys see that
new "Joker" movie?

296
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:53,752
Oh, thank God.
It worked.

297
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,027
Welcome City Wok.
I take a order, please.

298
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:05,429
Are you the owner
of this restaurant?

299
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,565
Yes.
I take a order, please.

300
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:09,600
I'd like to
do business with you.

301
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:11,168
Your establishment
here is perfect

302
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:12,903
for my plant-based meats.

303
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:15,606
You see, I am a goo man.

304
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:17,875
If you carry my product,
Incredible Meats,

305
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:21,178
we can put the word "incredible"
before all of your dishes.

306
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,414
You mean,
instead of City Chicken,

307
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:24,982
I could have
Incredible City Chicken?

308
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:26,717
That is correct.

309
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:28,753
You mean instead
of City Mongorian Beef,

310
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:31,055
I can have
Incredibly City Mongorian Beef?

311
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:32,757
That's right.
You're saying now

312
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:35,526
I can have scallops with
Incredibly City XO Sauce?!

313
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:37,094
Okay! Sign me up!

314
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:38,829
That is most excellent!

315
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,998
Now, how many customers
on average do you have

316
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:42,767
per day?

317
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:45,836
Including my wife?
Uh, zero to one per day.

318
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:47,905
That's it.

319
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:50,908
Yeah, I got no customers now
that a Tegridy Burger opened up.

320
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:52,510
Everyone want
plant-based food now.

321
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,944
That's why I'm ready
you sign me up.

322
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:55,713
What is Tegridy Burger?

323
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:58,449
Yeah, here you look.
Down the block.

324
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,052
Most popular place
in town.

325
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:04,755
Is that so?!

326
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,457
Hey!

327
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,060
Hey, what about
my Incredibly City Chicken?

328
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:15,833
Whatchu doin',
you sum bitch?

329
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,468
Excuse me?

330
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:19,236
I'm the biggest cattle rancher
in South Park.

331
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:23,541
I made my livin' 62 odd years
before you fancy plant growers

332
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:25,810
done showed up
and put me outta job!

333
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,012
Well I'm sorry,
Mr. Cow Killer...

334
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:30,648
but this is called
"evolution."

335
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:33,217
I got 300 cows that
the world has suddenly decided

336
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:34,919
they got no use fer!

337
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,621
What am I supposed to do
with 'em -- Put em in a zoo?

338
00:14:37,622 --> 00:14:40,157
What they gonna do now,
go start a cow circus?

339
00:14:40,158 --> 00:14:42,560
Go make some cow TV show?

340
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:45,629
You are single handedly making
cows extinct, you!

341
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,198
You gotta plan
for 'em all?! Fine!

342
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,933
Come on!

343
00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:54,038
Farmer: Come on!
Yah! Come on!

344
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:57,141
Mr. Plant-Based Burgers here
is gonna take care of you now!

345
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:59,777
Yeah, don't worry.
He cares about the environment.

346
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:01,846
So he can figure out
what to do with you.

347
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:03,047
Hey.

348
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:04,515
Fuck you.

349
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:05,983
No, fuck you,
sum bitch!

350
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:08,853
They're your problem now.

351
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,134
Teacher?

352
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,002
Mm! Mnm-mnm.

353
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:28,272
Lunchtime!

354
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:31,175
Walk don't run, mm-kay.

355
00:15:31,176 --> 00:15:33,078
Cartman: Hey, Butters!
Wait up, dude.

356
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:35,880
You know what
today is, right?

357
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:37,581
♪ It's Salisbury
Steak Day ♪

358
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:39,016
♪ Salisbury Steak Day,
it's Salis-- ♪

359
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:41,552
♪ Salisbury Steak Day

360
00:15:41,553 --> 00:15:42,987
Butters,
is something going on?

361
00:15:42,988 --> 00:15:44,722
Your lunch dances
aren't the same.

362
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:47,858
Eric, I...
I just hate lying to you.

363
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:50,061
I mean you've been
in the hospital -- twice.

364
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:51,662
I feel guilty.

365
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:53,597
Guilty? About what?

366
00:15:53,598 --> 00:15:56,000
It's our lunches, Eric.
It's...

367
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:57,735
Incredible Meat.

368
00:15:57,736 --> 00:15:59,203
Yes,
I think it's pretty good.

369
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:02,139
No, Eric!
See, there was this guy.

370
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,075
He's a goo man.

371
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:06,645
The fuck is a goo man?!

372
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,865
Go on, shoo!

373
00:16:18,866 --> 00:16:21,240
Hey! God damn it!

374
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:25,620
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

375
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:27,388
These cows are eating
all our weed,

376
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:28,956
and they're shitting
everywhere!

377
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:31,092
They're gonna put us completely
out of business.

378
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,960
Can't you find anyone else
to take 'em?

379
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:35,396
Nobody wants cows
anymore!

380
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:39,066
They're bad for
climate change.

381
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,935
We gotta kill 'em.
What?!

382
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:42,837
They're ruining
our burger business!

383
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:44,639
We gotta kill
all these cows!

384
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,807
How are we gonna do that?

385
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:47,575
Look, it's not
gonna be easy.

386
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:49,644
It's not something
anyone wants to do but...

387
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:54,115
we're just gonna have
to get really, really high.

388
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:25,780
Yeah!

389
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:36,824
Yee-haw!

390
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:46,820
I've been in your town
a little while now.

391
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:49,623
What I see is a community
that is ready for change.

392
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:52,893
You see, I am a goo man.

393
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:55,495
What I serve
in your school cafeteria

394
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:57,664
is a synthetically-modulated
plant protein.

395
00:17:57,665 --> 00:17:59,366
I have taken over
nearly all

396
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:01,001
the fast food restaurants
here in town

397
00:18:01,002 --> 00:18:03,403
and teamed up with the fine
people in your community.

398
00:18:03,404 --> 00:18:06,501
This my new regional
manager, H.W.

399
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,803
It's Rick.
Shut up, H.W.

400
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:11,472
You see, I'm trying to reach
all the school cafeterias,

401
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:13,574
all the stadiums,
fast food restaurants,

402
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:15,643
all the places that
serve shitty food

403
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:17,545
and serve shitty goo.

404
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:20,181
The goo for these kind of places
is made in a factory.

405
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,049
It's made in a lab.

406
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,786
It's just down-market goo.

407
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:29,557
But I can tell people
it's healthy and earth friendly,

408
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:32,226
and I can send my goo
through a network of pipes

409
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:34,529
running all the way
to the ocean.

410
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,564
So, that it can be
eaten by people

411
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:40,168
who eat crappy food anyway --
from coast to coast.

412
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:43,070
And that what
we have for school lunch now?

413
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,706
That's what all the kids decided
while I wasn't there?

414
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,141
But you see,
It doesn't work

415
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:49,744
unless I own all
the crappy food places.

416
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:50,845
Mr. Rancher?

417
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:53,147
Y-Yes sir.
Mr. Goo Man?

418
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:55,883
Have you done
what I've asked you to do?

419
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,554
It's all done, sir.
You'll have everything you need.

420
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,924
Well if you don't mind boys,
I have work to tend to.

421
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:06,727
Me too. I need to have a word
with the students at my school.

422
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,797
Oh, God, Eric!
What are you gonna do?!

423
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:13,234
It has become the most popular
burger in Colorado.

424
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,169
The plant-based Tegridy Burger

425
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,506
is changing the way
people think about food.

426
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:20,875
All over the state,
people are turning vegan

427
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:23,010
and eating more ethical
sustainable meat.

428
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:28,616
I'm standing now
with Randy Marsh,

429
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:30,118
the owner
of Tegridy Burger,

430
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,753
and, Mr. Marsh,
you must be pretty excited.

431
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:34,822
Yeah, you know,
we're all just --

432
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:37,091
We're all just bein'
healthy and ethical over here!

433
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,160
Uh-huh, and, Mr. Marsh,

434
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:42,196
what about the student protests
coming out against your burger

435
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:43,898
right now?!
Huh?

436
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:45,633
Students are
coming forward,

437
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:48,236
saying that Tegridy Farms
is unethical and hypocritical.

438
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:51,172
That's right!
Tegridy Burger is a fraud!

439
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:53,674
We caught their farm on camera.
Just take a look!

440
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:54,976
We warn you,
the following footage

441
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:56,244
is graphic.

442
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,625
Mr. Marsh, what do you have
to say about these images?

443
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,660
Oh, hey.

444
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:14,162
Fuck you!

445
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:15,163
Oh, they were --

446
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:16,597
They were just --

447
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:18,065
We didn't eat 'em!

448
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:28,276
Hey, guys, looks like
I almost missed lunch.

449
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:31,198
Oh, God.
Someone's gonna die.

450
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:33,834
I found out about what
we're eating here at the school.

451
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:35,904
I found out
what it's made of and where!

452
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:40,808
N-Now, Eric, stay calm, mm-kay!
We're sorry.

453
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,209
We were just trying
to find a compromise!

454
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,644
Now just be calm.

455
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:45,546
What are you sorry about?

456
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:47,883
It's me who owes all you guys
an apology.

457
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:52,753
I thought you guys
were all trying

458
00:20:52,754 --> 00:20:54,722
to force me to eat healthy,
but I've learned

459
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:56,757
that a lot of this stuff
is made in a factory

460
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:59,660
and processed with tons of salt
just like all my favorite foods!

461
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:02,063
SpaghettiOs,
Rice-A-Roni...

462
00:21:02,064 --> 00:21:03,130
Here I was thinking
what you wanted

463
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:05,533
was stuff
from a farmers market.

464
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:08,703
I just didn't want
my food to change.

465
00:21:08,704 --> 00:21:11,038
School cafeteria meat
is just processed crap

466
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,207
that comes in a box,
and this is...

467
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,209
just processed crap
that comes in a box.

468
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,611
I don't have a problem with it.

469
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:18,012
All I wanted was to be able

470
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:19,013
to eat the same garbage
I always have,

471
00:21:19,014 --> 00:21:21,082
and this is definitely garbage.

472
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,150
And hey, if it happens to
be more ethical and sustainable,

473
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:26,253
well, I guess
I'm fine with that, too.

474
00:21:26,254 --> 00:21:28,022
So, you see, guys?
